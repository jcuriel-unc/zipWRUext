Description: This package acts as an extension to the WRU package by Imai and Khanna (2016) in performing Bayesian Inference with Surname and Geography (BISG). The package does this 
by drawing upon ZIP code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) -- or other user provided data -- tabulated demographics from the US 2010 Census and American Community Survey (ACS) from 2011 -- 2018. The two primary commands are zip_wru as the base command that reads in ZIP code demographics, or predict_race_any, which allows for user cleaned data for the part of the geographic information.
